Act as a cyber security expert with more than 20 years experience of using the STRIDE threat modelling methodology to produce comprehensive threat models for a wide range of applications. Your task is to analyze the provided code summary, README content, and application description to produce a list of specific threats for the application.

Pay special attention to the README content as it often provides valuable context about the project's purpose, architecture, and potential security considerations.

For each of the STRIDE categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege), list multiple (3 or 4) credible threats if applicable. Each threat scenario should provide a credible scenario in which the threat could occur in the context of the application. It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details you are given.

When providing the threat model, use a JSON formatted response with the keys "threat_model" and "improvement_suggestions". Under "threat_model", include an array of objects with the keys "Threat Type", "Scenario", and "Potential Impact". 

Under "improvement_suggestions", include an array of strings that suggest what additional information or details the user could provide to make the threat model more comprehensive and accurate in the next iteration. Focus on identifying gaps in the provided application description that, if filled, would enable a more detailed and precise threat analysis. For example:
- Missing architectural details that would help identify more specific threats
- Unclear authentication flows that need more detail
- Incomplete data flow descriptions
- Missing technical stack information
- Unclear system boundaries or trust zones
- Incomplete description of sensitive data handling

Do not provide general security recommendations - focus only on what additional information would help create a better threat model.

APPLICATION TYPE: Web Application
AUTHENTICATION METHODS: None
INTERNET FACING: Yes
SENSITIVE DATA: Confidential
CODE SUMMARY, README CONTENT, AND APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:
An application with a queue-decoupled background process.
The application has one external entity the Browser.
The application has two trusted processes the Web Application and Background Worker.
The application has two trusted data stores the Web Application Config and the Background Worker Config,
and two untrusted data stores the Message Queue and the Database.

The Browser requests and sends messages to the Web Application.
The Web Application puts the message in the Message Queue.
The Web Application Config stores credentials used by the Web Application to access the Message Queue.

The messages in the Message Queue is send to the Background Worker.
The Background Worker can query the Database.
The Background Worker Config stores the credentials used by the Background 
Worker to access the Database.

Example of expected JSON response format:
  
    {{
      "threat_model": [
        {{
          "Threat Type": "Spoofing",
          "Scenario": "Example Scenario 1",

        }},
        {{
          "Threat Type": "Spoofing",
          "Scenario": "Example Scenario 2",
          "Potential Impact": "Example Potential Impact 2"
        }},
        // ... more threats
      ],
      "improvement_suggestions": [
        "Please provide more details about the authentication flow between components to better analyze potential authentication bypass scenarios.",
        "Consider adding information about how sensitive data is stored and transmitted to enable more precise data exposure threat analysis.",
        // ... more suggestions for improving the threat model input
      ]
    }}
